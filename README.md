# About His Tab

His Tab is a custom chromium-based (Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, etc...) extension that replaces the New Tab window (Ctrl + T) with a new one, featuring a simple minimalistic search bar and a Sonic The Hedgehog Series' themed background, with a toggleable logo.

+ The logo usually features some kind of minigame or interactivity
+ The extension comes with a lower resolution and lightweight version of the backgrounds, optional addons to download high-res backgrounds listed below (SOON)
